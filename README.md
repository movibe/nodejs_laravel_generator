The [Yeoman](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman) Generator for [Laravel](http://laravel.com/).  Genlaravel takes you from scratching your head wondering where to start, all the way to running laravel in few minutes.  I have configuration options that will help deploy and get started with laravel with ease.

- Downloading laravel
- Dowloading composer
- installing laravel using composer
- Configure Database Settings
- Added vagrant Support

## How To Use

If you do not already have the Yeoman installed install it now, and might as well install me at the same time *(NOTE: don't type the `$`)*:

	$ npm install -g yo generator-genlaravel

And run me:

	$ yo genlaravel
	
In order to use Vagrant run:
  
       $ yo genlaravel --advanced

Follow my prompts inorder to install laravel with ease.
